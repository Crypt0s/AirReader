About:
Airreader is a python script that interfaces with Kismet to produce reliable and screen-scrapable stdout output about the wireless networks your wifi card sees.  It's low maintainence and well-documented for use as an example kismet client as well.  I encourage those looking to write a kismet plugin to take a look at this code.

Pre-requisites:
Wifi card capable of being in monitor mode
Kismet must be installed and running. Airreader is a kismet client
